// CONTRACT 2: VAULT
// VAULT PROJECT

// Build a vault contract that:

// Accepts an ERC20 token address (like USDC) in the constructor  DONE
// Allows users to deposit that specific token into the vault   DONE
// Tracks each user's deposited balance in the vault  DONE
// Allows users to withdraw their deposited tokens DONE
// Emits an event when deposits happen DONE
// Emits an event when withdrawals happen DONE
// Has a function to check any user's current balance in the vault   DONE
// Has a function to check the vault's total token holdings DONE
// Calls the external ERC20 token contract to transfer tokens in and out  DONE
// Uses appropriate visibility modifiers (public, private, internal, external) CHECK BEFORE TSTING
// Uses appropriate data locations (storage, memory, calldata) where needed CHECK BEOFRE TESTING
// Persists all balances and state between transactions  DONE
// Handles the ERC20 approval pattern correctly (users approve before depositing)  DONE

// The contract should have these capabilities:

// User calls deposit(amount) → vault transfers tokens from user → updates user balance → emits event
// User calls withdraw(amount) → vault checks balance → transfers tokens back → updates user balance → emits event
// Anyone can view balances and vault totals
// State data never resets between function calls
